# kotlin-example
This is an introductory example of powerful kotlin programming. Here I am using a list of integers and doing opertions(even & odd numbers in list and list multiply by 2).
Although it's very easy but the trick is how many number of lines you use to solve this problem. In kotlin this is just a single line code :)
Requirement: Basic knowledge of functional programming and bit of knowledge about kotlin programming.
